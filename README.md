## Background ðŸŒ±
Born and raised in Manila, Philippines. I spent a year in Bangkok, Thailand for my freshman year of highschool, and then finished my last three years in Karuizawa, Japan. I went to Edinburgh, Scotland for Uni, and did a year abroad in Sant Cruz, California.

## Dependencies (e.g. things I need to run)
**Travelling** is one of my favorite ways to spend my time. I'm a bit of an introvert and I think the best way to improve is through stress tests. Also I love food and nothing beats home cooking.

**Sports**, specifically team sports is something I always did growing up. I flourish in environments with a strong team spirit, where everyone is working towards a shared goal. I play basketball and baseball but during these times of isolation I picked up running and bouldering.

**Movies** are another area I pay a lot of time to. I enjoy them because everyone can have an opinion on a movie and what they notice and pick-up on often shows a lot about a person. Some of my favorite movies: Princess Mononoke, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Parasite, and Moon Rise Kingdom.
